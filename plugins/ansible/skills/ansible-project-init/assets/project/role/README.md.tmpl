# base

Baseline packages and login banner for every managed host. Copy this role as the shape of a new function role: defaults as the public API, internal values in `vars/`, one task file per component, argument validation, and a Molecule scenario.

## Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `base_packages` | `[ca-certificates, curl]` | Packages installed on every host. |
| `base_motd_banner` | `Managed by Ansible. Manual changes will be overwritten.` | Text of `/etc/motd`. |

## Example

```yaml
- name: Configure base hosts
  hosts: base
  roles:
    - role: base
      vars:
        base_packages: [ca-certificates, curl, htop]
```

## Test

```bash
make test   # runs the Molecule scenario in molecule/default (needs Docker)
```
